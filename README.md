# PRIME-SC2-Tests

PRIME (Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement) Lab conducts AMS (accelerator mass spectroscopy) measurements for various elements.  A new source for the accelerator is to be installed and this code is for testing the control of the motor (Kollmorgen PowerPac N33HRHJ-LEK-M2-00) and motor driver ().

The driver is communicated to through a National Instruments cRIO module (NI-9512) and motor position read back via an 14-bit encoder reporting to a NI-xxxx cRIO module.
